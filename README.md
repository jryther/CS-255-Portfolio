# CS-255-Portfolio

The DriverPass system is a web application used to prepare users to take the DMV driving examinations.  The system allows clients to schedule in-person driving practice and access online learning material that includes mock tests.  We were approached by the CEO of the system to design the application according to their specifications to meet the driving students needs.  Reflecting on how the project went I believe that we did well designing the functions of the system using the different UML charts.  If I were to revise anything I would add more detail and actions into the activity diagrams.  I think that some actions were too generic and should have been broken out more.  Looking back I think the system design meets the users needs as the client intended.  I was able to do this by creating a business document that specifies the functional and non-functional requirements.  Creating a list of what needs to be created is much more accessible then an interview transcript.  In the future, I think I will continue to use the technique to analyze system requirements.  Combining this with different diagrams and requirements lists paints a picture of what the system needs and should be.  Using the tool set acquired over the course I will be a much better systems analyst in future endeavors.
